    I was born on June 17, 2003, in the culturally open region of Lagos State, 
    Nigeria, where my early years sparked a profound curiosity for the world 
    of technology. Growing up in an environment filled with potential and knowledge 
    of massive technology, I found myself drawn to computers, not just as tools, 
    but as gateways to endless possibilities, Privilleges and opportunities.

  <p>
    This fascination wasn’t fleeting; it grew into a lifelong passion that 
    would shape my education, ambitions, and future.
